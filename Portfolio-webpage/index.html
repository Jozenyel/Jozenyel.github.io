                <h1>My Name is José Ángel Esparza, a Future Full-Stack Web Developer</h1>
                <br>
                <p>When I was about to enter college in 2016, I told my father I wanted to study programming. He said that I was going to die from starving if I did that, and <s>obligated</s> encouraged me to go for another career. So I decided to go for chemical engineering</p>
                <br>
                <p>I sucked at chemistry. And I hated it. That's why I decided to try to do something else. After watching some YouTube videos about how to make money online, I decided to tap into the marketing space. Sooner than later, I got hired at a marketing agency</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, the idea of <strong>becomming a programmer</strong> never left my head. The problem was that I thought that, in order to become a programmer, I had to go to college again. But time was not on my side.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One day of March 2024, after doing some research about AI and marketing, I stopped across an ad of Codecademy, a platform that taught you all you needed to know to become a programmer and get a job. I saw that ad, remembered that I didn't need a degree to get a job in the marketing agency where I was, and thought <em>"This could be my chance"</em>. I just needed to learn programming and demonstrate my abilities</p>
                <br>
                <p>I enrolled in Codecademy, selected the Full-Stack Web Developer career path, did all the lessons...</p>
                <br>
                <p>And here we are.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And to demonstrate that I'm capable of building amazing things, I created this page. Below or in the header, you can see the <strong>projects</strong> I've built from scratch. In each of them you'll see:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>How I developed them</li>
                    <li>How they work</li>
                    <li>What technologies I used</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Hope you like them!</p>
